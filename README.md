# topG

topG - a programming language i wrote fully in java, (its called "topG" because a programming language called "G" apparently exists

### how to use

> 1. run the Shell.java file (i made python version of it, but that one is worse than the java version)

> 2. when it says "Execute command", type ".topg -type file"

> 3. copy path to your source file, and paste it. Then u can test it

### my plans to making it easier to use

> 1. i plan on making an ide, that would automatically run the Shell.java, except for that i am gonna need to customize the shell

### is it as good as ObJot?

> no. ObJot is my best project, and also the hardest one, tho i plan on making this even more complex, so its not "no", but "not yet"
